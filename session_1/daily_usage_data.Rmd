## The data

The data we're using today is the daily transport usage stats, initially produced for Covid reporting. This data provides a daily figure for usage by mode, indexed to a pre-Covid baseline figure.

The data is available [here](`r read_online(url)`) in a tidy, machine-readable format, and you can see the first 10 rows of the data below:

```{r}
data.table::fread(read_online(url)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

The data covers the following modes:

* all_motor_vehicles
* tfl_tube 
* tfl_bus
* national_rail 
* cycling
* bus_excluding_london

Motor vehicles is further broken down by vehicle type:

* cars
* light_commercial_vehicles
* heavy_goods_vehicles

Where no data is available for a specific date, you can treat that as an NA value.


## The task

1. Read the data in to R. You don't need to save the file locally, you can do this directly from the web link (`r read_online(url)`) 

2. Check that the data is clean, and the different modal names are in a publication-ready format **[You can use a combination of mutate and gsub/str_replace to swap underscores for spaces]{.spoiler}**

3. Create a ggplot line chart of the data, with dates on the x axis and value on the y axis, with one line per transport mode.

4. Make your chart publication-worthy! Aspects you may want to consider include:

* The theme and colours used in your charts
* The formatting and labelling of your chart axes
* What should the date range of your data be?
* Do you want to include weekends and bank holidays?
* Do you want to include every mode? Could you split the chart to show different groupings on different charts?
