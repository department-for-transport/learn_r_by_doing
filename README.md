# Learn R by Doing

This is a repository designed for free-form, hour-long R practice tasks. Each session provides you with a dataset, and a task to complete with that data.

## Getting started

There are a few steps to getting started with this repository, and it should take around 5 minutes to be ready to use. 

1. Clone the repository into Cloud R; you can use either SSH or HTTPS authentication to do this. If you're not familiar with cloning from Github, check out the [CRAN Shorts videos on how to do this here](https://departmentfortransportuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CoffeeandCodingRS-AS-ADD/EqSpUcaNVrtOrXTAtVhbyiwBTBuacWHpUlxoVs-FWaaH1w?e=QbyYtF)

2. Load up a basic set of libraries you'll need for the day with: 

`renv::restore()`

Press Y and enter when prompted, and allow renv to install the packages. When it's done, restart R with CTRL + SHIFT + F10

If you need any other libraries for the analysis you have planned, you can install them as normal.

3. You're set up and ready to go!
